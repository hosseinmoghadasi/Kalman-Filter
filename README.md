# Kalman Filter from Scratch in C++

## What is a Kalman Filter?  
A **Kalman Filter** is an algorithm that estimates the state of a system (e.g., position and velocity) by combining predictions from a mathematical model with noisy measurements. It is widely used in **tracking, robotics, computer vision, and navigation**.

### How It Works  
The Kalman Filter operates in two main steps:  

1. **Prediction**: Estimates the next state based on a motion model.  
2. **Update**: Adjusts the estimate using a new measurement, weighted by the **Kalman Gain**, which balances uncertainty from the model and sensor noise.  

### Why Use It?  
âœ… **Reduces noise** in sensor data  
âœ… **Optimally combines** multiple sources of information  
âœ… **Efficient** and works in real-time  

### 1D Kalman Filter for Position Estimation with Constant Velocity  
This C++ program implements a **1D Kalman Filter** to estimate the position of an object moving with a **constant velocity**.  

### Key Points:  
- The **velocity (\( v \)) remains constant** throughout the process.  
- The **covariance (\( P \)) increases** due to **process noise (\( Q \))**.  
- The **Kalman Gain (\( K \))** determines how much the measurement influences the estimate.  

### ðŸš€ Code Implementation  
Check out the full **C++ implementation** in the [`kalman_filter.cpp`](./kalman_filter.cpp) file.
